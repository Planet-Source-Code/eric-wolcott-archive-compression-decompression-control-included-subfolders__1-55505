### Description

This is a control i wrote that contains all functions for a good archive and compression program. I did not create am example program yet but i did include a a fw test functions that will show you how it creats an arhive from a folder and subfolers and how to extract all files form that archive as well as a single file. Each function included the option for compression/decompression. I am currently working on a program that will demonstraight how to use each function to their best ability. i figures i would post the control so you people can play around with it.
